		<h1>Local Reactions</h1>
		<br>
		<p>In a local point of view, some reactions to the Taliban wars and seize of Kabul included the displacement of about 2.5 million Afghans to neighboring countries and more, such as Iran and Pakistan, as some fled from the war that previously ensued while others fled to avoid the new Taliban government. Even with those that stayed in the country, a majority of the population holds little or no support or sympathy with the Taliban. In terms of escaping, some ways included the borders with said bordering countries, but with one of the more recently covered ones being through airplane. </p>
		<br>
		<p>There are news footages of hundreds, if not thousands, of civilians rushing and racing to reach the airplanes that contain US soldiers and officials that are leaving Afghanistan, filling the planes to their maximum capacities, with some even holding on to the plane outside, which led to a number of fatalities as they struggled to hold on. Some concerns a portion of the population has to the Taliban ruling Afghanistan includes a much more extreme implementation of Islamic law, as well as concerns regarding women's rights. This is especially after the former Afghan government being one that is much more secular than others, where the government would suddenly swap from a secular one to a religious one. </p>
		<br>
		<p>There are concerns about how 20 years of building rights around women would be wiped away so quickly. Another problem from locals would be the freedom of speech that may be limited, as the government may now go against those not for the new government and laws implemented. </p>

		<h1>International Reactions</h1>
		<br>
		<p>For international reactions, there are a number of reactions ranging from positive to negative, as what transpired in Afghanistan was no small event. By the time Kabul was seized, many countries had pulled their embassies and their workers from the country, mostly out of security and safety, with some exceptions like Pakistan. Other reactions are based on securing diplomacy with the new government in order to maintain stability in the region and their borders with Afghanistan, with some like Iran and China seeing this as an opportunity for Afghanistan to finally have peace, stabilizing the region. </p>
		<br>
		<p>With some thinking of this as a way to stabilize, some others, such as the northern neighbors of Afghanistan, think of this as a move that may de-stabilize the region, as extremists and crime organizations may flourish in the region.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="internationalreact2">
		<p>There are also concerns from countries, mainly western ones, regarding the safety and security of women and girls as well as the state of women's rights in the nation, with some wishing that the rights fought over the years will be maintained, such as those expressed by nations lke New Zealand; in addition, countries like the US are also concerned about the overall human rights situation in the country's next phase in history.</p>
		<p>Lastly, there are those that condemn the overthrow of the Afghan government, showing concern to the people of Afghanistan, and even unrecognizing the new Taliban government all together.</p>
