		<h1>History of the Taliban: Part 1</h1>
		<br>
		<p>The Taliban was formed during the 90s consisting of Islamic guerilla fighters, who were backed by the US and Pakistan during the Soviet occupation years. With the withdrawal of the Soviets in 1989, a power vacuum was left in the nation, which led to wars between the various guerilla leaders and their groups who had previously grouped with one another, due to difference of ideologies and ideas they had for Afghanistan in terms of stability and law for the future.
		One such leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, searched for new members for his group and looked to Pakistan for such. This was due to a number of Afghan refugees living in the neighboring country due to the wars against the Soviets and the infighting between guerilla groups. </p>
		<br>
		<p>These young refugees were also fit for recruitment, due to the similar Islamist ideologies Mullah Omar and the refugees had shared from getting their education from madrassas.
			These young members would soon be convinced by Omar to join the group under the new name of the Taliban, where the word "taliban" meant students in Pashto, where Pashtun. The Taliban grew from Pashtun majority lands, until their first major city, Kandahar, was controlled in November 1994, only months after the group was formed in September. 2 years after the capture of Kandahar, the Taliban had seized Kabul, taking over the government for the first time and establishing Afghanistan as an Islamic Emirate.
			This government would control the majority of the nation, with some regions still being contested, until 2001.</p>

		<h1>History of the Taliban: Part 2</h1>
		<br>
		<p> The Islamist group would be overthrown due to attacks from a US led coalition as a response to the terrorist attacks on such nation on September 11th. This was due to the Taliban-led Afghanistan withholding Osama Bin Laden, who was the leader of the Islamist group Al-Qaeda and the one who planned terrorist attacks against the US, including the 9/11 Attacks, where he was found and killed 10 years later. 
		Despite the overthrow, Taliban forces, now alongside Al-Qaeda allies, would continue fighting the new Afghan government and western forces. A peace deal was struck between the Taliban forces and the US in 2020, but despite this, fighting would still continue for the duration of the pre-Taliban capture of Kabul the next year. </p>
		<br> 
		<p> The Taliban wouldn't start capturing major centers and cities until in April of 2021, newly-elected US President Joe Biden wished to withdraw US forces from the country on September 11 of that year.
		Within the months after, and with foreign forces leaving Afghanistan, the Taliban took this as an opportunity to move and capture major towns and regions. This was due to the capture of the roads that connected the major cities from one another, which would prevent support and goods to be transported between Afghani military forces. </p>
		<br>
		<p> The group would continue capturing provinces in the north for the duration of June, as well as towns that slowly led to Kabul, the capital. On July 4, the Taliban would then control the birthplace of the group, Kandahar, as well as other major cities and provincial capitals during the first days of August. At the same time, border crossings with Tajikistan, Pakistan and Iran were captures during the months of June and July.
		Finally, with the approach of Kabul within reach, the forces would enter and retake control on August 15, 2021, where the previous government's officials fled days or hours before Taliban forces re-entered. All of this was due to the low morale from Afghan forces and the withdrawal of US and other foreign forces. On August 30, US President Joe Biden finally declared the war in Afghanistan over. </p>
